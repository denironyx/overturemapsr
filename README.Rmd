# OvertureMaps R Package

This package provides functions to interact with OvertureMaps datasets. It includes utilities for fetching data from S3 and converting it to sf objects for spatial analysis.

Overture Maps provides free and open geospatial map data, from many different sources and normalized to a common schema. This tool helps to download Overture data within a region of interest and converts it to a few different file formats.

## Installation

To install this package, you need to have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the package using the following commands:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("denironyx/overturemapsr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(overturemapsr)
## basic example code
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Usage

```{r }
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(overturemapsr)

# Bounding box of lisbon city
ls_bbox <- c(-9.181056,38.696137,-9.095569,38.750243)

# Fetching overture building data
ls_building <- record_batch_reader('building', bbox = ls_bbox)

```

## Functions

-   `get_all_overture_types`: This function returns all available OvertureMaps theme types.
-   `dataset_path`: This function returns the S3 path for the specified Overture dataset type.
-   `record_batch_reader`: This function retrieves a filtered dataset from the specified Overture dataset type, optionally within a bounding box, and converts it to an sf object.

#### Parameters

-   overture_type: Character. Required. The type of feature to select. Examples include 'building', 'place', etc. To learn more, run get_all_overture_types().
-   bbox: Numeric vector. Optional. A bounding box specified as c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax). It is recommended to use a bounding box to limit the dataset size and processing time. Without a bounding box, processing the entire dataset (e.g., buildings over 2 billion) can be time-consuming.

[Bounding Box Tool from Klokantech](https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/): Use this tool to find and specify bounding boxes of interest for your data queries.

### Notes

This package was inspired and based on the [OvertureMaps Python Repository](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py/tree/main). The functionality are similar and I will ensure to make the package stay updated.

##### Acknowledgement

Another inspiration for this package was based on the blog post by [Kyle Walker](https://walker-data.com/posts/overture-buildings/). Kudos!!!
